  "app.faq.access-to-publications": "How are the types of access to publications determined?",
  "app.faq.access-to-publications.definition": "The barometer uses the UnPaywall Detection Service. If access is open, three types of access are distinguished depending on whether access to full text is done directly from the publisher, on an open archive or both.",
  "app.faq.baro-buzz-lightyear": "Does the barometer go beyond open access to publications?",
  "app.faq.baro-buzz-lightyear.definition": "For the moment the barometer concerns only open access to publications. The expansion of the perimeter to other types of objects (including research and software data) is under study.",
  "app.faq.date-update": "When is the barometer updated?",
  "app.faq.date-update.definition": "The barometer will be updated every year. Each time, all the data is updated: both the perimeter of the publications and the type of access (closed / open). Indeed, a wave of discount to another, new DOI may appear, including history, thus modifying the scope of publications taken into account. In addition, a publication hitherto in closed access can go into open access, thus modifying the open access rate, including previous years. Thus, in trend, the measurement of the open access rate for the most recent year will be lower than for the previous years because open access can be done in a deferred way over time.",
  "app.faq.difference-ce": "What are the differences with the Open Science Monitor of the European Commission?",
  "app.faq.difference-ce.definition": "<p> The European Commission has published the <cta>Open Science Monitor</cta> whose design and production have been subcontracted to a consortium of CWTS, Esade and Lisbon Council by associating Elsevier as subcontractor. . The Commission's tool uses the Web of Science and Scopus business databases to define the publication field, as well as their affiliate (country) and disciplinary field. In the case of the French barometer, the perimeter is different (French affiliations only). The methodology developed by the French barometer is not commercially dependent, and is completely open (open code and resulting data in Open Data) .Ini, the European tool is based on the owner metadata of commercial bases. On the other hand, the French barometer has set up a transparent methodology to enrich open meta-data.</p> <p> As a result, these differences in methodological choices result in difference in the results:</p> <ul> <li> on the scope of the perimeter for France: envion 270,000 publications over 9 years in the European tool compared to about 860,000 publications over 6 years in the French tool.</li> <li> the Disciplinary declination in each tool is different (10 disciplines in the French barometer against 39 thematic in the European Monitor).</li></ul>",
  "app.faq.methodology-steps": "What are the steps of the barometer methodology?",
  "app.faq.methodology-steps.definition": "<b>The methodology put in place is divided into three steps:</b> <ol> <li> <b>Identification of publications with a French affiliation</b> Data on scientific publications come from the source UNPAYWALL , a bibliographic data aggregator (including Crossref service). More than 100 million doi are identified. The available meta-data are analyzed (author and in a small percentage case affiliation) to determine whether the publication is likely to have a French affiliation. With regard to the author's meta-data, a comparison is carried out with the authors having (had) a French affiliation and present in the open databases theses.fr, Pascal and Francis of the CNRS, HAL, and Orcid in particular. If yes, an automatic exploitation of public information on the web with redirection must be set up to confirm or invalidate the presence of a French affiliation. This approach allows, with a good level of certainty (only 4% of the publications considered French are mistakenly), to identify among all global publications, publications associated with authors affiliated with institutions located in France ( Public or private). </li> <li> <b>Enrichment of identified publications metadata</b> A supervised learning model has been trained on the Pascal and Francis bibliographic basis of the CNRS. Its purpose is to infer the disciplinary field of each publication from its title. In case of inference too uncertain, the disciplinary field retained for the publication is deducted from the Release Review.</li> <Li> <b>Detection of the type of access to publications</b> The barometer uses the service Unpaywall Detection. It regularly combines more than 50,000 sources to detect open access publications.</li></ol>",

For clinical trials aimed at determining the efficacy of a drug, it depends in particular on the phase in which the trial takes place: in phase 1, which aims to evaluate the toxicity of the drug, a trial involves only a small group of healthy or sick volunteers, whereas in phase 3, which evaluates the therapeutic value of the drug before it is authorized for marketing, a trial involves hundreds, even thousands of patients.<linebreak></linebreak>Before starting a trial, the team in charge of the methodology calculates the number of trials needed to answer the trial question with a sufficient degree of certainty while involving a reasonable number of patients to maximize their safety and allow for the quickest possible conclusion.<linebreak></linebreak>When a trial compares a group of patients receiving a new treatment with a group receiving a placebo or standard treatment, the allocation of patients to the two groups can be determined randomly by a computerized draw, in order to guarantee the objectivity of the comparison: this is called a randomized trial.

It allows a rapid circulation of results, even when these have been unsuccessful and are not the subject of a scientific publication. It avoids the duplication of trials, verifies the methodology used and increases the confidence of the patients involved. It also attests to the proper use of funds allocated to medical research. The World Medical Association's <cta0>Declaration of Helsinki</cta0>, which defines the ethical principles applicable to medical research involving human subjects, establishes since 2008 that all clinical trials should be registered in a public database before the first patient is enrolled and that the results should be made public. These principles have also been affirmed since 2006 by the World Health Organization. Registries exist to carry out these registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, an American registry that lists many studies conducted outside the United States, and the EU Clinical Trials Register in the European Union. Other registries exist but are not taken into account here because of their much lower use. In EU countries, the reporting of the results of clinical trials involving drugs within 12 months of their completion was made mandatory by a 2014 regulation, which came into force on January 31, 2022, the date the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) became operational. This requirement does not apply to non-drug clinical trials. The analyses presented do not take into account clinical trials that are not registered in a public registry, the number of which is not known.<linebreak></linebreak>The registration of clinical trials in a public registry should not be confused with prior declarations made to the competent authorities, such as ethics committees, to obtain authorizations to conduct these trials.

In addition, scientific publications published in 2018 or in previous years have an increasing openness rate over time.

This rate has increased by 10 points in one year. The level of open access varies significantly from one discipline to another. Some disciplines, such as the physical sciences and mathematics, have long been committed to opening up their publications, while others, such as chemistry, are undergoing rapid catch-up processes. The 2021 edition of the BSO also tracks the transparency of clinical trial results in France. It shows that only 57% of clinical trials completed in the last 10 years have shared their results publicly.",
