  "app.faq.access-to-publications": "How are the types of access to publications determined?",
  "app.faq.access-to-publications.definition": "The barometer uses the UnPaywall Detection Service. If access is open, three types of access are distinguished depending on whether access to full text is done directly from the publisher, on an open archive or both.",
  "app.faq.baro-buzz-lightyear": "Does the barometer go beyond open access to publications?",
  "app.faq.baro-buzz-lightyear.definition": "For the moment the barometer concerns only open access to publications. The expansion of the perimeter to other types of objects (including research and software data) is under study.",
  "app.faq.date-update": "When is the barometer updated?",
  "app.faq.date-update.definition": "The barometer will be updated every year. Each time, all the data is updated: both the perimeter of the publications and the type of access (closed / open). Indeed, a wave of discount to another, new DOI may appear, including history, thus modifying the scope of publications taken into account. In addition, a publication hitherto in closed access can go into open access, thus modifying the open access rate, including previous years. Thus, in trend, the measurement of the open access rate for the most recent year will be lower than for the previous years because open access can be done in a deferred way over time.",
  "app.faq.difference-ce": "What are the differences with the Open Science Monitor of the European Commission?",
  "app.faq.difference-ce.definition": "<p> The European Commission has published the <cta>Open Science Monitor</cta> whose design and production have been subcontracted to a consortium of CWTS, Esade and Lisbon Council by associating Elsevier as subcontractor. . The Commission's tool uses the Web of Science and Scopus business databases to define the publication field, as well as their affiliate (country) and disciplinary field. In the case of the French barometer, the perimeter is different (French affiliations only). The methodology developed by the French barometer is not commercially dependent, and is completely open (open code and resulting data in Open Data) .Ini, the European tool is based on the owner metadata of commercial bases. On the other hand, the French barometer has set up a transparent methodology to enrich open meta-data.</p> <p> As a result, these differences in methodological choices result in difference in the results:</p> <ul> <li> on the scope of the perimeter for France: envion 270,000 publications over 9 years in the European tool compared to about 860,000 publications over 6 years in the French tool.</li> <li> the Disciplinary declination in each tool is different (10 disciplines in the French barometer against 39 thematic in the European Monitor).</li></ul>",
  "app.faq.methodology-steps": "What are the steps of the barometer methodology?",
  "app.faq.methodology-steps.definition": "<b>The methodology put in place is divided into three steps:</b> <ol> <li> <b>Identification of publications with a French affiliation</b> Data on scientific publications come from the source UNPAYWALL , a bibliographic data aggregator (including Crossref service). More than 100 million doi are identified. The available meta-data are analyzed (author and in a small percentage case affiliation) to determine whether the publication is likely to have a French affiliation. With regard to the author's meta-data, a comparison is carried out with the authors having (had) a French affiliation and present in the open databases theses.fr, Pascal and Francis of the CNRS, HAL, and Orcid in particular. If yes, an automatic exploitation of public information on the web with redirection must be set up to confirm or invalidate the presence of a French affiliation. This approach allows, with a good level of certainty (only 4% of the publications considered French are mistakenly), to identify among all global publications, publications associated with authors affiliated with institutions located in France ( Public or private). </li> <li> <b>Enrichment of identified publications metadata</b> A supervised learning model has been trained on the Pascal and Francis bibliographic basis of the CNRS. Its purpose is to infer the disciplinary field of each publication from its title. In case of inference too uncertain, the disciplinary field retained for the publication is deducted from the Release Review.</li> <Li> <b>Detection of the type of access to publications</b> The barometer uses the service Unpaywall Detection. It regularly combines more than 50,000 sources to detect open access publications.</li></ol>",
