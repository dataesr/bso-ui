For clinical trials aimed at determining the efficacy of a drug, it depends in particular on the phase in which the trial takes place. In phase 1, which aims to evaluate the toxicity of the drug, a trial involves only a small group of healthy or sick volunteers, whereas in phase 3, which evaluates the therapeutic value of the drug before it is authorized for marketing, a trial involves hundreds, even thousands of patients.<linebreak></linebreak>Before starting a trial, the team in charge of the methodology calculates the number of trials needed to answer the trial question with a sufficient degree of certainty while involving a reasonable number of patients to maximize their safety and allow for the quickest possible conclusion.<linebreak></linebreak>When a trial compares a group of patients receiving a new treatment with a group receiving a placebo or standard treatment, the allocation of patients to the two groups can be determined randomly by a computerized draw, in order to guarantee the objectivity of the comparison: this is called a randomized trial. This randomization limits bias and ensures the initial comparability of patients included in a trial, reinforcing confidence in the results.",

It allows a rapid circulation of results, even when these have been unsuccessful and are not the subject of a scientific publication. It avoids the duplication of trials, verifies the methodology used and increases the confidence of the patients involved. It also attests to the proper use of funds allocated to medical research. The World Medical Association's <cta0>Declaration of Helsinki</cta0>, which defines the ethical principles applicable to medical research involving human subjects, establishes since 2008 that all clinical trials should be registered in a public database before the first patient is enrolled and that the results should be made public. These principles have also been affirmed since 2006 by the World Health Organization. Registries exist to carry out these registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, an American registry that lists many studies conducted outside the United States, and the EU Clinical Trials Register in the European Union. Other registries exist but are not taken into account here because of their much lower use. In EU countries, the reporting of the results of clinical trials involving drugs within 12 months of their completion was made mandatory by a 2014 regulation, which came into force on January 31, 2022, the date the <cta3>Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS)</cta3> became operational. This requirement does not apply to non-drug clinical trials. The analyses presented do not take into account clinical trials that are not registered in a public registry, the number of which is not known.<linebreak></linebreak>The registration of clinical trials in a public registry should not be confused with prior declarations made to the competent authorities, such as ethics committees, to obtain authorizations to conduct these trials.

From one discipline to another, the proportion of open access varies greatly from 75% for mathematics publications at 40% in engineering sciences. In addition, scientific publications published in 2018 or in previous years have an increasing openness rate over time. In particular, those published in 2018 are now open to 54% (+5 points compared to December 2019), and the rise, which concerns all the disciplines, is stronger in those less open.",

This rate has increased by 10 points in one year. The level of open access varies significantly from one discipline to another. Some disciplines, such as the physical sciences and mathematics, have long been committed to opening up their publications, while others, such as chemistry, are undergoing rapid catch-up processes. The 2021 edition of the BSO also tracks the transparency of clinical trial results in France.

Some disciplines, such as the physical sciences and mathematics, have been committed to opening up their publications for a long time, while others, such as chemistry, are undergoing rapid catch-up processes. After having introduced the monitoring of results associated with clinical trials in the 2021 edition, the new edition of the BSO extends its monitoring to doctoral theses (more than 70% openness in recent years), research data and code or software (22% of publications mention a sharing of the data produced and 20% of publications mention a sharing of code or software produced). The Monitor continues to track the openness of clinical trials, which stagnates at 57% sharing of results.",

Listening to a panel of experts, WeDoData imagined the new interface. Pauline Gaudet-Chardonnet and Jérémy Peglion ensured its integration. All these results were questioned and validated by the expert views of Claire Leymonerie, Florian Naudet, Didier Torny and Marin Dacos. We were also able to benefit from discussions with Nicholas DeVito. The local variations were considered with the help of Laetitia Bracco from the University of Lorraine. Finally, like a true conductor, Emmanuel Weisenburger ensured that everyone could work peacefully and brought his knowledge of the French research and innovation landscape. The 'Research data' and 'Codes or software' sections were carried out using the tools developed by Patrice Lopez from Science Miner.

It is limited by the legitimate exceptions set out in the law, for example with regard to professional secrecy, industrial and commercial secrets, personal data or content protected by copyright.<linebreak></linebreak>Unlike publications, there are no large reference databases of data produced by researchers. Although there are repositories that allow researchers to share data, sometimes on a massive scale, these repositories do not reflect the full thematic diversity and multiplicity of data underlying the scientific results of French research. In order to elaborate credible indicators on the data shared for this first edition, the Open Science Monitor has chosen to rely on the research literature produced by researchers and to mobilise artificial intelligence techniques to extract information from it.<linebreak></linebreak>As not all research approaches produce or use data, we only include in the corpus of publications studied those that explicitly mention data sets. We distinguish between cases that mention the use and/or production of data.<linebreak></linebreak>The Open Science Monitor uses an approach via the full text of French publications to detect the data used and/or produced.

  "app.faq.access-to-publications.entry": "What is the difference between open archive, publisher and open archive & publisher?",
  "app.faq.access-to-publications.definition": "The monitor uses the <cta>Unpaywall</cta> discovery service. If access is open, three types of access are distinguished depending on whether full-text access is directly from the publisher, only on an open archive, or both (publisher & open archive).",
  "app.faq.apc.entry": "How are the APCs calculated?",
  "app.faq.apc.definition": "If a publication is present in <cta0>OpenAPC</cta0>, its APC amount is immediately extracted from that source. Otherwise, we chose to calculate an estimate of APC by averaging the APC of other publications in that journal for the relevant publication year. If no or too little data is available, this average was done on the APCs of that publisher's publications for the relevant publication year. If the previous estimates fail, the value in the <cta1>DOAJ</cta1> is used.",
  "app.faq.bso.entry": "What is the BSO used for?",
  "app.faq.bso.definition": "The Open Science Monitor (BSO) is a tool to support the national open science policy. Its originality lies in its open approach, without recourse to proprietary sources, consistent with the vision of data sharing, the creation of open services and the promotion of the diversity of French scientific production. It measures the progress of open science in France through indicators of the openness of scientific publications, clinical trials, observational studies, doctoral theses, research data and research software.",
  "app.faq.bso-local.entry": "How to make your own monitor?",
  "app.faq.bso-local.definition": "The monitor can be adapted for each French institution, laboratory or funding agency able to compile its own list of publications. A tutorial is available in the tab dedicated to local variations. It is recommended to reconstitute the entire corpus each year.",
  "app.faq.classification.entry": "How are the scientific field classifications calculated?",
  "app.faq.classification.definition": "The monitor classification uses the title of the publication and its journal. It is an automatic classification model, trained with the labels of the PASCAL and FRANCIS (P&F) databases. The model predicts the P&F labels, which are then grouped into 10 macro-disciplines. The details of these groupings are in the open source code of the <cta>scientific-tagger</cta> module. For publications from HAL, a transcoding table allows to translate the HAL category to an existing category of the monitor.",
  "app.faq.community.entry": "Is there a BSO community?",
  "app.faq.community.definition": "Yes, the <cta>monitor user club</cta> is open to all to build a network of mutual support and federate skills.",
  "app.faq.corpus.entry": "How is the corpus of publications built up?",
  "app.faq.corpus.definition": "The corpus of publications of the BSO is made up of scientific publications of which at least one author has a French affiliation. Moreover, to integrate this corpus, these publications must have a Crossref DOI or a HAL identifier. This corpus is constituted from automatic methods that systematically harvest the access pages of the Crossref DOIs to identify publications with a French affiliation. This process is completed by data from PubMed and HAL. In addition, as part of the local barometers, each institution can also send a list of its own publications in the form of a standardized file following a common schema.",
  "app.faq.corpus-bso3.entry": "On what perimeter are the detections of mentions of datasets and software carried out?",
  "app.faq.corpus-bso3.definition": "The detections of mentions of research data and codes and software are performed on the publications identified in the barometer corpus and whose PDF could be downloaded (in open access or thanks to a subscription from a project institution). Thus, 60% of the scientific publications (open and closed) in the barometer were available for download in 2023.",
  "app.faq.date-missing.entry": "Why is the last year of publication missing from the charts?",
  "app.faq.date-missing.definition": "This time lag is explained by the \"dynamic\" aspect of the opening status; indeed, let's imagine the extreme case where the OA rate is measured as of January 1, N+1 for publications released in year N: the rate obtained would be relatively low and would undergo erratic variations during the year, for two reasons: on the one hand, because of the observation delay (an OA publication is not necessarily detected immediately open by Unpaywall, except for gold and diamond); on the other hand, a non-negligible part of the publications will go from \"closed\" to \"open\" in the following months, in particular with the logics of embargoes and mobile barriers, whose order of magnitude is rather 6-12 months. This is why we prefer to make the first measurement for the publications of year N in December N+1.",
  "app.faq.date-update.entry": "When is the barometer updated?",
  "app.faq.date-update.definition": "The barometer is updated at the beginning of each year. Each time, all the data is updated: both the scope of the publications and the type of access (closed/open). Indeed, from one update wave to the next, new DOIs may appear, including in the historical record, thus modifying the scope of the publications taken into account. In addition, a publication that was previously closed access may become open access, thus modifying the open access rate, including in previous years. Thus, in trend, the measure of the open access rate for the most recent year will be lower than for previous years, because open access may be delayed.",
  "app.faq.dates.entry": "What is the difference between publication date and observation date?",
  "app.faq.dates.definition": "The publication date of a scientific article is the date on which this article is published for the first time in a scientific journal. This data does not vary over time, contrary to its opening status for example. The date of observation corresponds to the dates of \"photographs\" of our various sources of data in order to immortalize the corpus of the barometer and its state at a moment T. We have been making these observations annually since 2018, when the first barometer was launched.",
  "app.faq.difference-ce.entry": "What are the differences with the European Commission's Open Science Monitor?",
  "app.faq.difference-ce.definition": "The European Commission has published <cta>the Open Science Monitor</cta>, the design and production of which has been subcontracted to a consortium including CWTS, ESADE and the Lisbon Council with Elsevier as a subcontractor. The Commission's tool uses the commercial Web of Science and Scopus databases to define the scope of publications, as well as their affiliation (country) and scientific field metadata. In the case of the French barometer, the scope is different (French affiliations only). The methodology developed by the French barometer is not dependent on commercial databases, and is completely open (open code and resulting data in open data). Thus, the European tool relies on the proprietary metadata of commercial databases. Conversely, the French barometer has implemented a transparent methodology for enriching open metadata.</p><p>As a result, these differences in methodological choices translate into differences in results:</p><ul><li>on the extent of the scope for France: approximately 270,000 publications over 9 years in the European tool versus approximately 860,000 publications over 6 years in the French tool.</li><li>the disciplinary variation in each tool is different (10 disciplines in the French barometer versus 39 themes in the European monitor).</li></ul>",

  "app.faq.economic-model.entry": "What does diamond, gold full APC, hybrid and other mean?",
  "app.faq.economic-model.definition": "We have chosen to distinguish 4 economic models:<ul><li>A publication is said to be Diamond if it is published in an open access journal indexed in the DOAJ and without APC. This category may be underestimated in the sense that some journals without APC are currently not included in the DOAJ.</li><li>A publication belongs to the Gold full APC category if it is published in a journal in open access but with APCs.</li><li>A publication is said to be hybrid when it is published in a closed access journal but with APCs.</li><li>In all other cases, a publication will belong to the \"Others\" category. This category includes in particular publishers who receive subscriptions for the most recent publications while distributing them in open access at the end of a fixed period (moving barrier), freemium models, Accepted Author Manuscripts following the agreement with Elsevier... But also publications for which no information on APCs has been collected. This category may be overestimated due to lack of information in data sources (DOAJ, OpenAPC).</li></ul>",
  "app.faq.mentions-detection-methodology.entry": "How are mentions of research data and code and software detected?",
  "app.faq.mentions-detection-methodology.definition": "To detect mentions of research data and code and software, the full text of the barometer publications was downloaded (where possible). Next, we used the open source tools <cta0>GROBID</cta0>, <cta1>DataStet</cta1>, and <cta2>Softcite</cta2> to detect Data Availability Statements, research data mentions, and code and software mentions, respectively. In addition, each of these mentions is characterized as relating to a use, creation, and/or sharing. For more information, feel free to visit our methodology page.",
  "app.faq.open.entry": "How is open access to publications detected?",
  "app.faq.open.definition": "To know the open access status of a publication with DOI, we rely on the information provided by the \"discovery\" tool <cta0>Unpaywall</cta0>. If this publication has a HAL identifier, we rely on the metadata provided by <cta1>HAL</cta1>.",
  "app.faq.pid.entry": "What publication identifiers does the barometer use? Why only those?",
  "app.faq.pid.definition": "The monitor takes into account publications with a DOI Crossref and/or a HAL identifier. A unique identifier is required to avoid duplicates. Additionally, to find out if a publication is open access, an open access \"discovery\" tool is needed. <cta0>Unpaywall</cta0> provides this tool for Crossref DOIs, and <cta1>HAL</cta1> provides open access metadata for publications with a HAL ID. To our knowledge, there is no other open access discovery tool applicable to other identifiers. For this reason, non-Crossref DOIs are not taken into account, such as Datacite DOIs.",

A small half of the theses defended in 2010 are open, while about ¾ of the theses defended at the end of the 2010s are open. The embargo periods temporarily show a slight decrease of the opening rate for the most recent years of defences.<linebreak></linebreak>The majority of doctoral theses are available in open access on the Internet, sometimes after a period of restriction. The temporal restrictions in the diffusion are of two kinds, embargo or confidentiality, and depend on the type of diffusion, free or restricted, chosen by the author:<linebreak></linebreak>- the embargo applies only to theses intended to be disseminated on the Internet. During the embargo period, the thesis must be disseminated in restricted access, in the French academic community.<linebreak></linebreak>- the confidentiality can apply as well to the theses intended to be diffused in free access on internet as to the theses intended to be diffused in restricted access within the premises of the institution of defense or of the French university community. During the period of confidentiality, no one can have access to the thesis. For the most recent years, the opening rate appears slightly lower, notably because of the embargo periods of one year on average.",

For theses defended from September 2016 onwards, the doctor cannot oppose the dissemination of his/her thesis within the whole academic community. On the other hand, the doctor can temporarily oppose the dissemination of his/her thesis in free access on the internet by subjecting it to an embargo: a thesis under embargo is available for consultation in restricted access within the French academic community during the whole period of the embargo, before becoming available for consultation in free access on the internet.

The ORCID identifier facilitates reliable and transparent interconnection between researchers, their work and the structures to which they belong.
