For clinical trials aimed at determining the efficacy of a drug, it depends in particular on the phase in which the trial takes place. In phase 1, which aims to evaluate the toxicity of the drug, a trial involves only a small group of healthy or sick volunteers, whereas in phase 3, which evaluates the therapeutic value of the drug before it is authorised for marketing, a trial involves hundreds, even thousands of patients.<linebreak></linebreak>Before starting a trial, the team in charge of the methodology calculates the number of trials needed to answer the trial question with a sufficient degree of certainty while involving a reasonable number of patients to maximise their safety and allow for the quickest possible conclusion.<linebreak></linebreak>When a trial compares a group of patients receiving a new treatment with a group receiving a placebo or standard treatment, the allocation of patients to the two groups can be determined randomly by a computerised draw, in order to guarantee the objectivity of the comparison: this is called a randomised trial.

It allows a rapid circulation of results, even when these have been unsuccessful and are not the subject of a scientific publication. It avoids the duplication of trials, verifies the methodology used and increases the confidence of the involved patients. It also attests to the proper use of funds allocated to medical research. The World Medical Association's <cta0>Declaration of Helsinki</cta0>, which defines the ethical principles applicable to medical research involving human subjects, establishes since 2008 that all clinical trials should be registered in a public database before the first patient is enrolled and that the results should be made public. These principles have also been affirmed since 2006 by the World Health Organisation. Registries are dedicated to carry out these registrations: <cta1>ClinicalTrials.gov</cta1>, an American registry that lists many studies conducted outside the United States, and the <cta3>EUCTR</cta3> and the <cta2>Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS)</cta2> in the European Union. Other registries exist but are not taken into account here because of their much lower use. In European Union countries, reporting the results of clinical trials involving drugs within 12 months of their completion was made mandatory by a 2014 regulation, which came into force on January 31, 2022, the date the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) became operational. This requirement does not apply to non-drug clinical trials. However, the Open Science Monitor observes all clinical trials without distinction. The analyses presented do not take into account clinical trials that are not registered in a public registry.<linebreak></linebreak>The registration of clinical trials in a public registry should not be confused with prior declarations made to the competent authorities, such as ethics committees, personal protection committees (Comités de protection des personnes, CPP) and ANSM (Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé, National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products), to get authorisations to conduct these trials.",

  "app.baro-national.data.intro": "Research data is a primary material for knowledge. France has decided to include this essential object of research in two national policies, the National Plan for Open Science and the Roadmap for Data, Algorithms and Source Code. Our ambition is to ensure that the data produced by French public research is progressively structured in accordance with the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), preserved and, when possible, opened.<linebreak></linebreak>Managing, preserving, opening and sharing data are all actions that favour the progress of research. They enable the pooling of efforts to produce and collect data within the research community, and to consolidate and multiply the results of their use.<linebreak></linebreak>The obligation to open up public research data is laid down in the 2016 Law for a Digital Republic. It is limited by the legitimate exceptions set out in the law, for example with regard to professional secrecy, industrial and commercial secrets, personal data or content protected by copyright.<linebreak></linebreak>Unlike publications, there are no major reference databases for all the data produced by the research community. Although there are repositories that allow researchers to share data, sometimes on a massive scale, these repositories do not reflect the full thematic diversity and multiplicity of data underlying the results of French research. In order to elaborate credible indicators on the data shared for this first edition, the Open Science Monitor has chosen to rely on the research literature produced by researchers and to mobilise artificial intelligence techniques to extract information from it.<linebreak></linebreak>As not all research approaches produce or use data, we only include in the corpus of publications studied those that explicitly mention data sets. We distinguish between cases that mention the use and/or production of data.<linebreak></linebreak>The Open Science Monitor uses an approach via the full text of French publications to detect the data used and/or produced.

  "app.faq.access-to-publications.entry": "What is the difference between open archive, publisher and open archive & publisher?",
  "app.faq.access-to-publications.definition": "The monitor uses the <cta>Unpaywall</cta> discovery service. If access is open, three types of access are distinguished depending on whether full-text access is directly from the publisher, only on an open archive, or both (publisher & open archive).",
  "app.faq.apc.entry": "How are the APCs calculated?",
  "app.faq.apc.definition": "If a publication is present in <cta0>OpenAPC</cta0>, its APC amount is immediately extracted from that source. Otherwise, we chose to calculate an estimate of APC by averaging the APC of other publications in that journal for the relevant publication year. If no or too little data is available, this average was done on the APCs of that publisher's publications for the relevant publication year. If the previous estimates fail, the value in the <cta1>DOAJ</cta1> is used.",
  "app.faq.bso.entry": "What is the BSO used for?",
  "app.faq.bso.definition": "The Open Science Monitor (BSO) is a tool to support the national open science policy. Its originality lies in its open approach, without recourse to proprietary sources, consistent with the vision of data sharing, the creation of open services and the promotion of the diversity of French scientific production. It measures the progress of open science in France through indicators of the openness of scientific publications, clinical trials, observational studies, doctoral theses, research data and research software.",
  "app.faq.bso-local.entry": "How to make your own monitor?",
  "app.faq.bso-local.definition": "The monitor can be adapted for each French institution, laboratory or funding agency able to compile its own list of publications. A tutorial is available in the tab dedicated to local variations. It is recommended to reconstitute the entire corpus each year.",
  "app.faq.changement.entry": "Why do the figures displayed may change over time?",
  "app.faq.changement.definition": "The Monitor is based on a living database, maintained and updated every week by the MESR team. These updates include weekly feedback from institutions, quarterly updates of metadata from Crossref and HAL, and once a year, the inclusion of metadata from PubMed and those collected via web scraping. Thus the scope of publications on which the indicators are calculated changes, generally at the margin, each week, and more substantially each quarter and year, which can lead to variations of a few points in the monitoring indicators.<linebreak></linebreak>As a result, any comparison with previous data would be inconsistent due to the evolution of this perimeter. Only comparisons between different obseravtion dates on a like-for-like basis make sense.",
  "app.faq.classification.entry": "How are the scientific field classifications calculated?",
  "app.faq.classification.definition": "The monitor classification uses the title of the publication and its journal. It is an automatic classification model, trained with the labels of the PASCAL and FRANCIS (P&F) databases. The model predicts the P&F labels, which are then grouped into 10 macro-disciplines. The details of these groupings are in the open source code of the <cta>scientific-tagger</cta> module. For publications from HAL, a transcoding table allows to translate the HAL category to an existing category of the monitor.",
  "app.faq.community.entry": "Is there a BSO community?",
  "app.faq.community.definition": "Yes, the <cta>monitor user club</cta> is open to all to build a network of mutual support and federate skills.",
  "app.faq.corpus.entry": "How is the corpus of publications built up?",
  "app.faq.corpus.definition": "The corpus of publications of the BSO is made up of scientific publications of which at least one author has a French affiliation. Moreover, to integrate this corpus, these publications must have a Crossref DOI or a HAL identifier. This corpus is constituted from automatic methods that systematically harvest the access pages of the Crossref DOIs to identify publications with a French affiliation. This process is completed by data from PubMed and HAL. In addition, as part of the local monitors, each institution can also send a list of its own publications in the form of a standardized file following a common schema.",
  "app.faq.corpus-bso3.entry": "On what perimeter are the detections of mentions of datasets and software carried out?",
  "app.faq.corpus-bso3.definition": "The detections of mentions of research data and codes and software are performed on the publications identified in the monitor corpus and whose PDF could be downloaded (in open access or thanks to a subscription from a project institution). Thus, 60% of the scientific publications (open and closed) in the monitor were available for download in 2023.",
  "app.faq.date-missing.entry": "Why is the last year of publication missing from the charts?",
  "app.faq.date-missing.definition": "This time lag is explained by the \"dynamic\" aspect of the opening status; indeed, let's imagine the extreme case where the OA rate is measured as of January 1, N+1 for publications released in year N: the rate obtained would be relatively low and would undergo erratic variations during the year, for two reasons: on the one hand, because of the observation delay (an OA publication is not necessarily detected immediately open by Unpaywall, except for gold and diamond); on the other hand, a non-negligible part of the publications will go from \"closed\" to \"open\" in the following months, in particular with the logics of embargoes and mobile barriers, whose order of magnitude is rather 6-12 months. This is why we prefer to make the first measurement for the publications of year N in December N+1.",
  "app.faq.date-update.entry": "When is the monitor updated?",
  "app.faq.date-update.definition": "The monitor is updated at the beginning of each year. Each time, all the data is updated: both the scope of the publications and the type of access (closed/open). Indeed, from one update wave to the next, new DOIs may appear, including in the historical record, thus modifying the scope of the publications taken into account. In addition, a publication that was previously closed access may become open access, thus modifying the open access rate, including in previous years. Thus, in trend, the measure of the open access rate for the most recent year will be lower than for previous years, because open access may be delayed.",
  "app.faq.dates.entry": "What is the difference between publication date and observation date?",
  "app.faq.dates.definition": "The publication date of a scientific article is the date on which this article is published for the first time in a scientific journal. This data does not vary over time, contrary to its opening status for example. The date of observation corresponds to the dates of \"photographs\" of our various sources of data in order to immortalize the corpus of the monitor and its state at a moment T. We have been making these observations annually since 2018, when the first monitor was launched.",
  "app.faq.difference-ce.entry": "What are the differences with the European Commission's Open Science Monitor?",
  "app.faq.difference-ce.definition": "The European Commission has published <cta>the Open Science Monitor</cta>, the design and production of which has been subcontracted to a consortium including CWTS, ESADE and the Lisbon Council with Elsevier as a subcontractor. The Commission's tool uses the commercial Web of Science and Scopus databases to define the scope of publications, as well as their affiliation (country) and scientific field metadata. In the case of the French monitor, the scope is different (French affiliations only). The methodology developed by the French Open Science Monitor is not dependent on commercial databases, and is completely open (open code and resulting data in open data). Thus, the European tool relies on the proprietary metadata of commercial databases. Conversely, the French monitor has implemented a transparent methodology for enriching open metadata.</p><p>As a result, these differences in methodological choices translate into differences in results:</p><ul><li>on the extent of the scope for France: approximately 270,000 publications over 9 years in the European tool versus approximately 860,000 publications over 6 years in the French tool.</li><li>the disciplinary variation in each tool is different (10 disciplines in the French monitor versus 39 themes in the European monitor).</li></ul>",

This category includes in particular publishers who receive subscriptions for the most recent publications while distributing them in open access at the end of a fixed period (moving barrier), freemium models, Accepted Author Manuscripts following the agreement with Elsevier...

The dissemination of theses in electronic format is governed by two successive ministerial decrees. For theses defended between 2006 and 2016, the doctor cannot oppose the diffusion of his/her thesis in restricted access within his institution of defense. For theses defended from September 2016 onwards, the doctor cannot oppose the dissemination of his/her thesis within the whole academic community. On the other hand, the doctor can temporarily oppose the dissemination of his/her thesis in free access on the internet by subjecting it to an embargo: a thesis under embargo is available for consultation in restricted access within the French academic community during the whole period of the embargo, before becoming available for consultation in free access on the internet. Only confidential theses are not available to anyone.",

The ORCID identifier facilitates reliable and transparent interconnection between researchers, their work and the structures to which they belong. The adoption of the ORCID identifier by researchers consolidates their digital identity and the visibility of their work, and makes it possible to feed data from ORCID into research information systems, thus avoiding double entries.",

  "app.worksmagnet.paragraph1": "The works-magnet offers a number of curation functions. The tool is therefore aimed at specialists who can judge the quality of metadata. The tool interrogates various massive databases (OpenAlex, BSO, Datacite) and formats the information to facilitate exploration and correction where necessary. These massive databases each use large-scale automatic processing tools. An expert curatorial eye is needed to continue to improve the quality of the metadata. As far as possible, the corrections resulting from these curations are fed back upstream to ensure that the same errors are not repeated. The aim is to build up a set of high-quality metadata that can be re-used by anyone who wishes to do so. The aim is to propose a new curation paradigm: curation is not carried out in a two-way relationship between a producer and a consumer of data. Instead, a group of data users propose corrections that are visible to all, and that can benefit everyone. As well as correcting the cases reported, in some cases the data collected can also be re-used as learning data for algorithms, so that the models used in the future are more effective.",
  "app.worksmagnet.paragraph2": "One of the major features of the works-magnet is the improvement of affiliation metadata. This is of vital importance in the bibliometric analyses carried out by institutions. They are also used to establish the Leiden ranking (open). Improving the quality of this data will enable us to benefit collectively from more reliable monitoring and analysis tools in the future.",
  "app.worksmagnet.paragraph3": "The works-magnet aims to fill a gap: at a time when \"open research information\" (to use the terms of the Barcelona Declaration) is progressing rapidly, there is a clear need to draw on the knowledge of experts to raise the level of quality of metadata. It is highly likely that in the months and years to come, more structured networks for collecting information will be set up, for example by OpenAlex or following the work of the COMET working group initiated by the California Digital Library. It may take a long time to set up this kind of structure, and the works-magnet is positioning itself to meet this need as of now."
